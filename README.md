# submersible
A toolbox for self-contained, spatial, audiovisual experiences.

## What's in this repository?
At the moment, this repo will contain the core tech as well as one or more implementations of "something that can be installed in a box-like room and has two or more screens and two or more channels of sound output that render a virtual 3d scene"

In the future, this repo will house that core tech and integrations for environments you might work in to make these kinds of things.

For now, though, we're working on it. Bleeding-edge users beware.
